This is a project done for class in Fall 2012 by Nora Hayes and Sam Mater.

TextGeneration takes in three command-line arguments: k, M, and a file. k 
represents the number of characters used to generate each new character that
the program prints out. This will affect how closely the generated text 
matches the original -- we've found that a k between 7 and 20 seems to work 
best. M is the number of characters that you want generated, and the file is 
the text that you are passing in. We've included buffy scripts and transcripts
of the 2012 presidential debates as sample base text files.
